Project Highlights:
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the dataset
 Visualized distributions and correlations using Seaborn & Matplotlib
 Implemented multiple classification models including:
ðŸ”¹ Random Forest
ðŸ”¹ Decision Tree
ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression
ðŸ”¹ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
ðŸ”¹ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
ðŸ”¹ XGBoost
Compared model performances using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
 Identified the best-performing algorithm for mushroom classification
